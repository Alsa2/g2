# Unit 2: A Distributed Weather Station for ISAK

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

## Proposed Solution

Considering the client requirements an adequate solution includes a low cost sensing device for humidity and temperature
and a custom data script that process and anaysis the samples acquired. For a low cost sensing device an adequate
alternative is the DHT11 sensor[^1] which is offered online for less than 5 USD and provides adequare precision and
range for the client requirements (Temperature Range: 0°C to 50°C, Humidity Range: 20% to 90%). Similar devices such as
the DHT22, AHT20 or the AM2301B [^2] have higher specifications, however the DHT11 uses a simple serial communication (
SPI) rather than more eleborated protocols such as the I2C used by the alternatives. For the range, precision and
accuracy required in this applicaiton the DHT11 provides the best compromise. Connecting the DHT11 sensor to a computer
requires a device that provides a Serial Port communication. A cheap and often used alternative for prototyping is the
Arduino UNO microcontroller [^3]. "Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and
software"[^4]. In additon to the low cost of the Arduino (< 6USD), this device is programmable and expandable[^1]. Other
alternatives include diffeerent versions of the original Arduino but their size and price make them a less adequate
solution.

## Success Criteria

1. The solution provides a visual representation of the Humidity and Temperature values inside a dormitory (Local) and
   outside the house (Remote) for a period of minimum 48 hours.
1. ```[HL]``` The local variables will be measure using a set of 4 sensors around the dormitory.
2. The solution provides a mathematical modelling for the Humidity and Temperature levels for each Local and Remote
   locations. ```(SL: linear model)```, ```(HL: non-lineal model)```
3. The solution provides a comparative analysis for the Humidity and Temperature levels for each Local and Remote
   locations including mean, standad deviation, minimum, maximum, and median.
4. ```(SL)```The Local samples are stored in a csv file and ```(HL)``` posted to the remote server.
5. Create a prediction the subsequent 12 hours for both temperature and humidity.
6. A poster summarizing the visual representations, model and analysis is created. The poster includes a recommendation
   about healthy levels for Temperature and Humidity.

# Criteria B: Design

## System Diagram **SL**

![](sysdim_sl.png)

**Fig.1** shows the system diagram for the proposed solution (**SL**). The indoor variables will be measured using an
Arduino microprocessor and the sensor DHT11 conencted to the local computer (Laptop) located inside a room. The outdoor
variables will be requested to the remote server using a GET request to the API of the server
at ```192.168.6.147/readings```. The local values are stored in a CSV database locally.

**Fig.2** shows the system diagram for the proposed solution (**HL**). The indoor variables will be measured using a
Raspberry PI and four DHT11 sensors located inside a room. Four sensors are used to determine more precisely the
physical values and include measurement uncertainty. The outdoor variables will be requested to the remote server using
a GET request to the API of the server at ```192.168.6.147/readings```. The local values are stored in a CSV database
locally and POST to the server using the API and TOKEN authentication. A laptop computer is used for remotely
controlling the local Rasberry Pi using a Dekptop sharing application (VNC Viewer). (Optional) Data from the local
raspberry is downloaded to the laptop for analysis and processing.
